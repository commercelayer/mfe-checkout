## Testing a local react-components build

`CL_RC_LOCAL_PATH` in `.env.local` points at a local
`commercelayer-react-components` checkout. When set, `next.config.js` aliases
`@commercelayer/{core-components,react-hooks-components,react-components}` to
that checkout's `dist/`, and forces `react`, `react-dom`, `@commercelayer/sdk`
and `@commercelayer/organization-config` to resolve from this app's
`node_modules` so no dependency ends up loaded twice.

`package.json` is deliberately left pointing at `pkg.pr.new`; deploys are
unaffected. Use `pnpm rc:bump [sha]` to move it to a published commit.

If a change to the library does not show up:

1. `pnpm rc:watch` must be running — the alias points at `dist/`, not `src/`.
2. It only works with webpack. `pnpm dev` passes `--webpack`; plain
   `next dev` throws, because Turbopack ignores `resolveAlias` for these
   packages and would serve the published copy without saying so.
3. `pnpm build` throws while the variable is set. That is intentional.
